			<p>Hello everyone, today, I got up and went to nku and started with my Statistics class. I found out that I had a quiz on friday, and the teacher tod us that it would be one of the harder ones. After statistic and my Biopsychology class, I had lunch from Qdoba, in the student union. I then went to Griffen Hall, where the College of Informatics is, and decide to draw/sketch till I the rest of my group for midterms showed up. We got most of it done in the time frame of 3 hours or so, including the time we would normally have class, but didnt due to midterms. QAfter that I had Media Literacy class and it started with us talking about our weekend. I mention how, on Sunday, I had dinner with my cousin and her husband, and son, as well as with my grandma. After dinner we went to my grandma's house and played a game,called Quarkle, I made a bet, which I won since my younger cousin, my cousin's son, won the game. If he won, I gave him a penny, and if he lost, then everyone else, in the 4 player game, won then everyone else got a penny(I have to much pennies), he didn't dissapoint. After that I went to sleep.</p>

         <p>How's everyone doing this fine Wednesday?  I am doing pretty well. Classes went by with nothing very interesting, except for the fact that, me amd my group finished, and submited our group midterm for SWeb Pograsmming, and I got 3/5ths of the way done with my individual midterm. Also my younger brother and I started paying through the campaign of Samurai Warriors 4, which is a hack and slash game, made by Koei, that is set in te Sengoku era of Japan.</p>
