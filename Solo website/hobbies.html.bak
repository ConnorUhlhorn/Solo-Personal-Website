							<p>  I love sketching in my free time, specifically when I am between classes and have no work to do, and/or in the evening.
								I find it very calming and it helps to take my mind off of everything else going on and just focus on one thing. 
								I usually sketch anime characters and prefer to shade in/color in black, white, and gray for my sketches.</p>
