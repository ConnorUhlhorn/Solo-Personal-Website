			<h1>Why do I like this organization?</h1>
       
			<hr />
       
			<p> There are plenty of reasons why I enjoy this organization. For 1 it is non-profit so they are doing what they are doing for a change over for money. Also I am very passionate when it comes to animals. I love my 2 furry companions and I want other people to experience the joy of having a furr,or feathered companion or 2, wether it be cats,dogs, or a combination of them, or any other animal. I also hope that those homeless animals find homes with loving people. In other words, I am very passionate about animals having a better life and a family. I also like how there are many ways to help, and also they are educating people, who want it, on how to take care of the animals, and about the animals in general.</p>
