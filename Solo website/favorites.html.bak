					<dt>A classic horror, slasher film that is sort of a satire movie series of other slasher films.</dt>

					<img src="images/thing.jpeg ">
					<dt> The movie takes place in a remote part of Antartica,where a group of American research scientists are disturbed at 
					their base camp by a helicopter shooting at a sled dog. When they take in the dog, it brutally attacks both human beings and canines in the camp and
					they discover that the beast can assume the shape of its victims. This leads to a face off with the crew  against the vicious creature before it picks them 
					all off, one by one. it is a reat horror movie and I highly reccomend it to anyonewho loves horror and hasn't seen it yet.</dt>

					<dt> This movie is based on a book series. It covers the first book, whith the same name as it. In the book, the main charcter,a young boy named 
					Ender Wiggin is sent to a training academy,that is located in orbit above the Earth, to train to become a soldier 
					that will one day battle against a vast alien race known as "Buggers". The movie does well adapting the book and bringing a visual expeience to the story.</dt>
